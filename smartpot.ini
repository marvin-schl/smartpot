[Soil Moisture]
# This section calibrates the soil moisture sensor. Keep in mind that any calibration action will only effect the
# python software. Depending on the Calibration it is possible that the Node-RED settings have to updated manually

# Calibration of the soil moisture sensor connected to adc channel 1.
# The calibrated output value is calculated from the Output value out [V]  follows:
#     calibrated_out = scaling*(out - offset)
# Calibration procedure:
#    1.) Set both Values to zero.
#    2.) Connect the sensor and make sure it's 100% dry.
#    3.) Measure the voltage offset and adjust offset_calibration value to get an calibrated_out of 0.
#    4.) Pull the sensor onto a defined soil moisture level.
#    5.) Adjust scaling in such a way that calibratet_out matches the desired value.

# Calibration procedure:

#    2.) Connect the sensor and make sure it's completly dark.
#    3.) Measure the voltage offset and adjust offset_calibration value to get an calibrated_out of 0.
